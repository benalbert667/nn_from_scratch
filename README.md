# nn_from_scratch
A simple feed-forward neural network made from scratch in vanilla Java

A self-teaching project, code of the actual network (FeedForwardNetwork.java) is based on the first two chapters of the online book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html.

Test.java tests the network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which in its current state usually results in the network acheiving around 80% accuracy.
